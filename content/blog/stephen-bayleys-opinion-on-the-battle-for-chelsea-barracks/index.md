[Stephen Bayley&#8217;s opinion on the battle for Chelsea Barracks][1]

> &ldquo;The fabulous absurdity of the media "debate&rdquo; between Prince Charles and Richard Rogers is that each is a historical relic. The prince is a throwback to the 18th century and beyond, the architect is a suntanned survivor of the 20th. We are now in the 21st, a century with priorities of its own. Charles&rsquo;s unreflective and ludicrous enthusiasm for anachronism in architecture has its equivalent in Rogers&rsquo; dogmatic and doctrinaire insistence on aesthetic conflict with metal and glass.&ldquo;
