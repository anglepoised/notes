Electronic tagging of offenders [inspired by Spiderman cartoon strip][1].

> &#8220;Jack Love was a newly appointed district judge in Albuquerque, New Mexico, when he saw the cartoon strip in his local newspaper in August 1979. He recalled it instantly three years later when bloody rioting erupted at the badly overcrowded local prison and 30 young inmates were murdered. Judge Love was convinced that the device could be produced in real life, enabling him to ease prison overcrowding by sentencing minor criminals to house arrest.&#8221;
