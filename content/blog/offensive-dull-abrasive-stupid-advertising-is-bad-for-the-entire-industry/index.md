> I&rsquo;m appalled by those who [judge] advertising exclusively on the basis of sales. That isn&rsquo;t enough. Of course, advertising must sell. By any definition it is lousy advertising if it doesn&rsquo;t. But if sales are achieved with work that is in bad taste or is intellectual garbage, it shouldn&rsquo;t be applauded no matter how much it sells. Offensive, dull, abrasive, stupid advertising is bad for the entire industry and bad for business as a whole.
