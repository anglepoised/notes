[LJ Kruzer &#8211; Tam][1]

> Before working on this piece, I spent a lot of time listening to the track and album as I really wanted to immerse myself in the subtlety of the music and create a video that reflected my own emotional response.
>
> Visual concepts developed as a response to repeat listening. I was then inspired to develop a new technique using expressions in After Effects. This technique allows me to create markers in the audio track which can influence pretty much any effect or property of the visuals.
