[OSM 2008: A Year of Edits][1].

> &ldquo;An animation showing edits to the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OpenStreetMap.org</a> project during 2008. OpenStreetMap is a wiki-style map of the world and this animation displays a white flash each time a way is entered or updated. Some edits are a result of a physical local survey by a contributor with a GPS unit and taking notes, other edits are done remotely using aerial photography or out-of-copyright maps, and some are bulk imports of official data.&rdquo;
