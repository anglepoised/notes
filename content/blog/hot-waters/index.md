The Guardian [interviews Sarah Waters][1] about her new novel, [Fingersmith][2], and the [BBC adaptation][3] of [Tipping the Velvet][4]:

> &#8220;She scotches the notion that she is a &#8216;Dickensian&#8217; writer. &#8216;People say &#8216;you&#8217;re like Dickens&#8217;, but I&#8217;m not like Dickens. Zadie Smith is a Dickensian writer because she&#8217;s writing about society now, just as Dickens was writing about his society. To write these faux Victorian novels is quite different.'&#8221;
