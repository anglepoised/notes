[Neon Genesis Evangelion &#8211; Perfect Collection][1] released on DVD in the US.

> &#8220;Anno&#8217;s watershed series was not the first anime series to combine giant robots with apocalyptic Christian symbols and elements of Jungian psychology, but it did so with exceptional panache. It&#8217;s an intriguing and sophisticated work, utterly unlike any American animated film.&#8221;
