If we were a rich world, we&rsquo;d innovate our way out of this environmental crisis. We&rsquo;d breed algae that piss petrol, and albatross that inhale hydrocarbons and then soar upwards to breach into the stratosphere, exhaling ozone. But we aren&rsquo;t a rich world, so we&rsquo;re tightening our belts and hoping something will turn up. Nothing will turn up though, because we&rsquo;re all there is to do the turning up.
