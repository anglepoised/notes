Londoners treat the underground not as a stage set, a place where we&rsquo;re on display, but as a neutral space, one in which we don&rsquo;t overtly direct our attention at each other. People sneak glances at each other, of course they do, but the operative word is &ldquo;sneak&rdquo;. They don&rsquo;t look openly, in the way they would elsewhere. The main focus of people&rsquo;s attention is inward. They go into themselves. Or they go into the world of whatever entertainment they&rsquo;re carrying.
