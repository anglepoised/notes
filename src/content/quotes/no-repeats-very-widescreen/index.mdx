The sky is better than Sky©TM; no repeats; very widescreen; endlessly fascinating; no discernable plot: perfect telly. And however long you stare at it you never feel like buying anything &#8211; except perhaps occasionally cotton wool or candy-floss. And the detail, the work that’s gone into it &#8211; it’s truly awesome; terrifying. No wonder we watch telly.
