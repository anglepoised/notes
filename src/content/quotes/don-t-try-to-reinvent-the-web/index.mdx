All attempts to inhibit the flow of information and make it work exclusively for the benefit of an organisation, whether it&rsquo;s the government of China or Universal Records, are doomed. The genie is out of the bottle for good. Media owners talk wistfully of &ldquo;owning&rdquo; particular ideas or activities on the internet. They should stop. This is a mirage, glimpsed most often by those who spend little time on the web.
