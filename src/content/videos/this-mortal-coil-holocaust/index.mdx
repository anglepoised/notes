I got into [Pixies](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies_(band)>) at the beginning of 1993, just before they broke up. Perfect timing, as ever. They were my first introduction to [4AD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4AD) and set the tone for me. I was completely into the early/mid 90's era 4AD but 80's era 4AD - Cocteau Twins, Dead Can Dance, This Mortal Coil - were completely uninteresting to the 16 year old version of me.

But now I'm older, I have a good-enough Celestial Jukebox and no desire to pogo I have the perfect set of circumstances to dig into early dreampop.
