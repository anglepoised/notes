A beautiful taster of the forthcoming [Posthuman][1] DVD.

> Syn Emergence is a project which examines my own associative relationships between sound, form and space.
>
> The project is constructed according to a range of specific sonic and spatial scale rule sets (micro, component, meso and macro) which I designed as part of a cross-disciplinary notation/cartographic system.
>
> The processes of the film will be used for the forthcoming Posthuman (myself and Josh Doherty) album entitled &lsquo;Syn Emergence&rsquo; released next Spring.
