[BBC iPlayer &#8211; Imagine &#8211; A Wild Sheep Chase: In Search of Haruki Murakami][1]

> &ldquo;Alan Yentob explores the mysterious, offbeat, sexually charged world of Japan&rsquo;s most popular and internationally acclaimed writer.
>

Notoriously enigmatic and media-shy Murakami has always shunned radio and television. However, he agreed to a rare and frank off-camera interview with the producer for this programme.&rdquo;
