Nautilus are holding a [Break-Fux-A-Thon Competition][1], to be judged by [Venetian Snares][2], Jay from [Coredump][3] and Schmee from [Planet Mu][4].

> &#8220;Make the track with the Break-Fux-A-Thon break and any other sounds or anyway you like &#8211; (NO LIMITATIONS) But the main purpose of this contest is to DSP FUCK the break, the more DSP fuckery the more likely you are to win! [The] winner will choose any of the Break-Fux-A-Thon participants to make a remix of a composition in their back catalog.&#8221;

Competition closes on the 5th of May. Related: [current Break-Fux-A-Thon entries][5].
