This isn't an issue with [Codeship](https://codeship.com/) as such, but it can affect it.

I had a task in an `npm` script that created some directories for a couple of cli tools that (for whatever reason) expected directories to be present but wouldn't create them:

```json
"copy": "mkdir -p dist/{dir1,dir2}",
```

This task worked locally (on OS X El Capitan) but the first time I tried to build on Codeship, my tests failed.

Working out why was pretty straightforward. Codeship images use [Ubuntu](https://codeship.com/documentation/security/vm-and-Infrastructure/). Ubuntu uses `dash` rather than `bash` for `/bin/sh`…

```shell
$ ls -l /bin/sh
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 Feb 19  2014 /bin/sh -> dash
```

…and of course, `dash` [doesn't support curly bracket expansion](https://lwn.net/Articles/343924/). Huh. [Who knew](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1535185)?

There wasn't much point spending time on such a simple line, so I went with the cheap fix of listing out each `mkdir` in long form:

```json
"copy": "mkdir -p dist/dir1 && mkdir -p dist/dir2",
```

I need to remember that:

1. Avoiding fancy stuff is sensible (curly bracket expansion isn't particularly fancy, but it wasn't exactly saving me a great deal of effort, either).
2. Subtle cross-platform issues crop up all over the place. Using Vagrant, Docker or Otto for consistent development, stage, CI and production environments is a good idea where time allows.
3. Running tests on a range of platforms is worthwhile. Time to get up and running with [Appveyor](http://www.appveyor.com/), I think.

I like using [`npm` as a build tool](http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/), but keep coming across niggling issues like this.
