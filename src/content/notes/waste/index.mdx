> There is another kind of waste […] and that's overconsumption. Eat food you really don't need to eat and that too has been wasted.

— <cite>[Jay Rayner, _Pizza Hut's 2,880-calorie monster: a taste of a burgeoning global food crisis_](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/mar/02/pizza-hut-2880-calorie-monstrosity-worlds-burgeoning-food-crisis)</cite>
