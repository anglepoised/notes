[The history of Pocky][1] (that&#8217;s [Pocky][2], not [pocky][3]).

> &#8220;If this was the West, Pocky would have government health warnings on the boxes and Glico would be facing bankruptcy litigation for knowingly luring millions of unwitting adults and children into chocoholicism, with all the associated consequences for social cohesion. Pocky eaters would be huddled on street corners, forced to fulfill their cravings under the scornful eyes of unblemished passersby.&#8221;
