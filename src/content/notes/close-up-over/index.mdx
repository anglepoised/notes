A Japan Times [interview with Haruki Murakami][1], in which he discusses the conflict between closed systems and open systems in society:

> The world is very chaotic today. You have to think about so many things &#8212; your stock options, the IT industry, which computer you should buy, junk bonds. You have 54 channels on DTV. You can know anything you want from the Internet. It&#8217;s so complicated, and you feel lost. But if you enter a small, closed circuit, you don&#8217;t have to think about anything. The guru or dictator will tell you what to do and think. It&#8217;s simple. So people like to enter those small, closed systems &#8212; just like the very intelligent people who gather in Aum Shinrikyo. But once you enter that system, you cannot escape. The door is closed.
