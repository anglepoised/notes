The novelist Alan Warner [dreams of the perfect novel][1]:

> &#8220;This is the way to discover books: an undisciplined charge straight into them. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve always bristled at canons. It would have taken all the surprise, fun and excitement away if I&#8217;d known what I was meant to read. After all, once Herr Professors have decided what the great novels are, is there a particular order they should be read in, perhaps? It&#8217;s nonsense. A contributing factor to a writer&#8217;s creative personality is not just the books they&#8217;ve read but the order they read them in. It influences how we feel about each book, the way a certain piano chord may sound different between two other chords rather than after a silence.&#8221;
