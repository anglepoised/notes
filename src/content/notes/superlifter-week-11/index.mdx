This is my first attempt at getting back on the weeknotes bandwagon and doing some accountability, after some pondering in [Weeknotes debug](/notes/weeknotes-debug).

To recap, these are the things I planned to do.

1. Finish and send a new business proposal I’ve spent a week blocked on
2. Write up my part of a client report
3. Finish reading [No Bullshit Strategy](https://basicarts.org/book/), then finish a proper 1.0 version of our business strategy

It went… pretty well, I think.

I didn’t manage to finish the proposal, but this is _probably_ fine because I’m talking with the client next week and everything will probably have shifted again. I came to the conclusion that one of the reasons I found it so hard to get started was that I realised that I have never written a formal (or even semi-formal) business proposal before, so this is new territory that feels like it shouldn’t be. Carry-forward for next week: figure this out, then do it, then template it.

I did write up everything I could for the client report. Not surprising, as researching and writing is my happy place, although it’s nice to be a contributor rather than a collator for a change.

I didn’t read No Bullshit Strategy, but I did finish a 1.0 version of our business strategy. I’m happy with the result and I’m also fine with not having read the book first. I figured it made just as much sense to read it afterwards and see if it helps me do a new version. So I’ll consider that a win.

Two out of three isn’t bad. It’s also probably worth me noting where I went off-plan.

I spent a _lot_ of the week thinking about and using ChatGPT. I had a brainwave about how it might help with some very tedious text-munging tasks I’d been putting off for literally years. It worked: I was and remain impressed. But then, not being able to resist the urge to finish up something that I thought would take hours rather than week, I fell into a rabbit hole of LLM use. Good times.

## Media

- Book: [How High We Go in the Dark](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57850265-how-high-we-go-in-the-dark). January is probably not the best month for books about pandemics, but this is good.
- Article: [The digital equivalent of wearing a fake Chanel bag](https://www.garbageday.email/p/the-digital-equivalent-of-wearing). Despite my positive LLM experiences this week, I am also totally down with this Garbage Day article about how AI Art is a big “why”.
- Music: Cybotron - [Enter](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enter_(Cybotron_album)>) (aka Clear). I had somehow never listened to this end to end, despite being a big Juan Atkins fan. From a [Pitchfork retrospective review](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18886-cybotron-enter/): “Like William Gibson, who was writing _Neuromancer_ while they were recording _Enter_, they pulled this off by building a future that inspired other people enough to make it a reality.”
