While discussing a [New York Times article][1] on [L33T][2] speak [invading schools][3], one slashdotter ends up [reworking The Lord&#8217;s Prayer with modern idioms][4]:

> &#8220;Our Father, who 0wnz heaven, j00 r0ck! May all 0ur base someday be belong to you! May j00 0wn earth just like j00 0wn heaven. Give us this day our warez, mp3z, and pr0n through a phat pipe. And cut us some slack when we act like n00b lamerz, just as we teach n00bz when they act lame on us. Please don&#8217;t give us root access on some poor d00d&#8217;z box when we&#8217;re too pissed off to think about what&#8217;s right and wrong, and if you could keep the f3i off our backs, we&#8217;d appreciate it. For j00 0wn r00t on all our b0x3n 4ever and ever, 4m3n.&#8221;
