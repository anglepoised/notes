<i>LJ:</i> &#8220;I used to play in the school jazz band, don&#8217;t you know? Third
trumpet, I was. Third trumpet. Never played a solo in me life. We were awfully good,
though. Watermelon Man, In The Mood, Basin Street Blues, all the classics. Once played
at a soiree in Longleat House, don&#8217;t you know? Mostly school fetes, though.
Yes, yes, school fetes, school fetes&#8230;&#8221;
