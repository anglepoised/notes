[The origin of London&#8217;s place names][1] (numerous but scanty details) and [London Place names][2] (fewer names with more detail). Books: [A Dictionary of London Place-names][3] and [Discovering London Street Names][4] (currently out of print).

Grappling with Stephen Inwood&#8217;s [A History of London][5]. Some rate it over Peter Ackroyd&#8217;s [London: The Biography][6]. Either way, reading both would be extreme overkill.
