[Takashi Murakami&#8217;s][1] enjoyable [Kaikai Kiki exhibition][2] at the Serpentine Gallery in Hyde Park finishes on the 26th of January. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend going with a hangover, mind.

Related: [images from the exhibition][3], [a recent Guardian interview][4] and [the WINK installation][5] for the Vanderbilt Hall in Grand Central Terminal.
