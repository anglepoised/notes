Last weekend, in links:

- Tea, talk, a [chaos-inducing toy][1] and [Sailor Moon figure][2] (from [TFAW][3]) courtesy of the ever-spangly [Robyn][4].
- A preview screening of the [new Harry Potter film][5] (courtesy of those nice people at [Bloomsbury][6]), followed by a complicated 15-person meal at [Kettners][7] (unfortunately not courtesy of anyone) and half a bottle of [Jose Cuervo Gold][8]. Why is it so hard to buy [grenadine][9] at 2am in Shepherd&#8217;s Bush? Or at any time in any place, come to think of it?
- [The Lord Mayor&#8217;s Show][10] [firework display][11] by the Thames, followed by beer and nonsense at the redeveloped [Anchor][12].
- Tasty (if messy) tapas at [Mar I Terra][13] (Blackfriars), followed by drinks at the recently refitted portrait-tastic [The Ring][14], topped off with moredulwichwine and the well-scheduled [Classic FM Chiller Cabinet][15].

More like that, please.
