F&auml;llt Publishing&#8217;s [Invisible Cities][1] installation &#8220;offers the opportunity to experience an intimate series of portraits of the world&#8217;s cities painted with sound&#8221;.

> A series of artists were invited to contribute a five minute audio work inspired by and utilising the sounds of the cities they cherish. Their contributions range from quiet and contemplative to noisy and frenetic with styles ranging from the pristine digital crackles of Washington DC based artist [Richard Chartier][2] (Whitney Biennial, 12k, LINE) to the near-silence of Tokyo based ultra-minimalist [\*0][3] (Nosei Sakata).

All contributions are available as .mp3s from F&auml;llt&#8217;s Invisible Cities site.
