> Not only is [Christian Vogel](http://www.last.fm/user/cristian_vogel/) an avid user of the site, he uses his journal to publish stories of his life as a musician, his record label station 55 records, to tease us with intriguing technicalities of his production experiments, and much more.

Good to see Vogel The Young Modernist working [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/) the way it should be done.
