Guardian journalist goes [looking for UK underground music][1]. Finds it. The end.

> &#8220;My tour begins in Sheffield. In the past, the south Yorkshire city has produced bands that embody all that is great about British rock and pop: irreverence, intelligence, fun &#8230; The Fat Truckers are lugubrious about both their city and its music scene, like a synthesizer-prodding equivalent of Monty Python&#8217;s Four Yorkshiremen. According to them, most things in Sheffield are rubbish, except for a local condiment called Henderson&#8217;s Relish.&#8221;
>
> &#8220;Aside from Fat Truckers, who weld pounding synthesizers to songs about &#8220;cheap motorbikes, import-export business and multiplex cinemas &#8211; we&#8217;re a social comment on modern living&#8221;, there&#8217;s I Monster, who had a huge hit last year with Daydream; the Mu Chan Clan, fronted by a Japanese ex-pat (&#8220;sort of shouting and screaming, quite punky&#8221;); the splendidly named Kid Acne and the equally splendidly named Kings Have Long Arms. All fit into the Sheffield blueprint, which matches futuristic electronica influenced by the city&#8217;s industrial past with a bizarre sense of humour.&#8221;
