> &#8220;Look closely &#8212; well, you don&#8217;t even have to look that closely &#8212; and you&#8217;ll swear you&#8217;re watching an updated version of Homicide: Life on the Street.&#8221;

PalmBeachPost.com [reports][1] on [FX Network&#8217;s][2] new drama, [The Shield][3]. Should be worth watching if it&#8217;s &#8220;of [Homicide][4] quality&#8221;. No UK release date on the patchy [IMDb entry][5].
