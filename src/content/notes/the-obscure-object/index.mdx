[Jeffrey Eugenides][1]&#8216; [Pulitzer Prize-winning][2] novel [Middlesex][3] is out in [paperback][4] in September and it&#8217;s well worth [reading][5]:

> Emotions, in my experience, aren&#8217;t covered by single words. I don&#8217;t believe in &#8220;sadness,&#8221; &#8220;joy&#8221; or &#8220;regret.&#8221; Maybe the best proof that language is patriarchal is that it oversimplifies feeling. I&#8217;d like to have at my disposal complicated hybrid emotions, Germanic train-car constructions like, say, &#8220;the happiness that attends disaster.&#8221; Or: &#8220;the disappointment of sleeping with one&#8217;s fantasy.&#8221; I&#8217;d like to show how &#8220;intimations of mortality brought on by aging family members&#8221; connects with &#8220;the hatred of mirrors that begins in middle age.&#8221; I&#8217;d like to have a word for &#8220;the sadness inspired by failing restaurants&#8221; as well as for &#8220;the excitement of getting a room with a minibar.&#8221;

This post has hardly been influenced at all by the advance copy from those nice people at [Bloomsbury][6]; it&#8217;d be plugged here regardless.
