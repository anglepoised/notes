I tend to lose track of things I’ve managed to get done, so have been thinking about keeping [weeknotes](http://weeknotes.com/) for a while. I reckon monthnotes might be a better bet for me, though. This isn’t really in the spirit of things but seems more achievable. I’m going to date them from when I first registered this domain which is also close to when I started freelancing.

So, month 105 then. Off we go…

The beginning of September marked the end of my first major stint doing operations for [Suburb](http://wearesuburb.com/). In the 8 months from December we managed to (deep breath) move offices, tweak the business model, re-brand, develop and launch a new site, shift everything onto a shiny new domain, hire a bunch of nice people and improve a lot of the under-the-hood processes and tools. I hadn’t done a great deal of operations work before so I’m grateful to them for taking a punt and trusting me enough to muck about with their business. I hope I’ll get the chance to go back and do phase 2 soon.

After the best part of a year at Suburb and last year’s long run at [Grand Union](http://www.thegrandunion.com/), now feels like a good time to get back into hands-on development. There’s so much exciting stuff happening right now. [HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.org/), [Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) and [Usable cross-browser polyfills](http://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-browser-Polyfills)! [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/) and [responsive web design](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/)! [Web performance optimisation](http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2010/05/07/wpo-web-performance-optimization/)! [Modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com/)! [The transformative effects of git](http://dashes.com/anil/2010/09/forking-is-a-feature.html)! [node.js](http://www.gnegg.ch/2010/09/why-node-js-excites-me/) and [YUI 3](http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/09/29/video-glass-node/)! It’s hard to know where to begin… so of course I’ve ended up doing some dull-but-useful WordPress 3.x work for most of this month. Sigh. Next month.

I tried hard to avoid playing [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net/) and succeeded, with a degree of regret. However, avoiding the lure of the craft meant I had enough time to pick up with [Uncharted Audio](http://unchartedaudio.com/) after the traditional summer break (people don’t buy records in the summer, apparently). We launched [a new shop](http://shop.unchartedaudio.com/) based on the rather excellent [Bandcamp](http://bandcamp.com/). No coding required but adding metadata and uploading tracks, art and lyrics took a surprisingly long time. We’re very happy that we can sell records with much less faff, though. We released a free odds and ends compilation called _Dance Audit Hour_ to celebrate (read: plug) the new shop. We wanted to spread it as far and wide as possible so released it under a Creative Commons license. It’s been downloaded a couple of thousand times to date and was featured on [WFMU](http://wfmu.org/)‘s [Free Music Archive](http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/WFMU/blog/Easing_Back_In_With_Leave_It_Out). Worth doing.

We also released Cursor Miner’s [Luna](http://unchartedaudio.com/releases/cursor-miner-luna/) EP…

There isn’t normally the time (or, more to the point, budget) for video but we had to have something for Luna and were lucky to have [Jamie Bradshaw](http://www.jimjamgraphics.com/) make one for us. Watching the renders go from [datamoshing test](http://vimeo.com/9609087) to [full-on space glitch](http://vimeo.com/14034471) earlier in the year was hugely entertaining.

Luna brings us one step closer to the release of [Requires Attention](http://unchartedaudio.com/releases/cursor-miner-requires-attention/), Cursor Miner’s fourth studio album. More about that in month 106, if all goes according to plan.
