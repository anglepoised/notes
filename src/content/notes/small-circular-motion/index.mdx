Currently listening to a couple of albums from John Zorn&#8217;s [Tzadik][1] label; [Memories Are My Only Witness][2] by [Yuka Honda][3] (of [Cibo Matto][4] fame) and [Dreams][5] by [Otomo Yoshihide&#8217;s New Jazz Ensemble][6]. Both come highly recommended. Related: [Improvised Music from Japan][7], [J-Music][8].
