Better late than never.

I’ve realised I can condense weeknotes planning and accountability into one post, saving a bit of wear and tear on the old RSS feed. Mondays are probably best for recap and planning.

How did I do last week?

1. Proposal: finished it, sent it, had it accepted, got a “good enough” template out of it, realised afterwards that I could have done it in a fraction of the time and that would have been fine. Oh well, getting it accepted was the main thing.

2. BT case study: didn’t start.

3. Content and marketing tasks: did lots, still lots to do. This is what I was afraid of, but at least I went in prepared.

I’m consistently getting two things done a week, not three. So maybe doing one thing a week is a better I mean, obviously, doing one thing is probably always better and is still, what, about 46 things a year? But is it practical? Let’s find out.

I’m already well into this week, so for the rest of this week, I’m going to focus on the post-proposal tasks of research and tidying up the notes I do have. This is giving myself a bit of a pass. There are other things happening:

1. We got our first trade mark! So now we can say Measured™️. Probably. Part of my thinking time is figuring out what we need to do here.

2. I’m starting up the process of engaging a new lawyer. This is in a good way: needs change as businesses grow.

3. Reactive reviews of a report are required.

## Media

For last week.

- Book: I’m working my way through [Proxima](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18270328-proxima) by Stephen Baxter. Space opera is the only thing I have room for in my head at the moment.
- Article: [Hippy, capitalist, guru, grocer: the forgotten genius who changed British food](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/jan/23/nicholas-saunders-forgotten-genius-changed-british-food), a wonderfully sprawling read about Nicholas Saunders. I hadn’t realised he was behind so much.
- Music: Nourished By Time - [Erotic Probiotic 2](https://nourishedbytime.bandcamp.com/album/erotic-probiotic-2)
