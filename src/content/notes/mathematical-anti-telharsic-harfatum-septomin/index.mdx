The BBC&#8217;s new(ish) comedy series [Look Around You][1] is very nice indeed. The narrator (Nigel Lambert) sounds very much like the voice of Club News on Chris Morris&#8217; Blue Jam, but there&#8217;s no credit for him on the Blue Jam album so this conclusion may be a product of my fevered imagination. The Observer [interviewed creators Robert Popper and Peter Serafinowicz][2] a few weeks ago:

> &#8220;&#8216;We&#8217;re not just trying to do a pastiche of old Seventies programmes &#8211; that&#8217;s the starting point and it&#8217;s a joke in itself, but it&#8217;s just one joke and it would quickly get boring if that&#8217;s all there was. We wanted it to be taken for granted from the beginning, so that the audience at least partly buys into the idea that they are watching an old programme,&#8217; Popper says. &#8216;It would be so easy to drop in references to flares or Spangles that would trigger all those &#8220;I remember that&#8221; responses, but we&#8217;ve done it through the costumes and the sound and the visuals. We think it&#8217;s about 1979 or 1980. It was a very bleak time for fashion.'&#8221;
