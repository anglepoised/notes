The only song my nearly-10 Gen Alpha son had in common in our end of year music wraps was [this Hen Ogledd track from 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6ShFisioXk).

If it had been a couple of months later, [this track from Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARgkOqLUJ98) might have made the cut, too.

I find watching how he discovers music at this age completely fascinating. His current epic playlist (which I guess is the maxed-out modern day equivalent of my childhood’s radio-to-C90 approach) consists of:

- artists his schoolfriends have mentioned (a fair amount, notably a rehabilitated Michael Jackson)
- artists his parents have mentioned (tiny amounts, but some)
- songs he’s heard at art class (mostly radio pop)
- songs we’ve heard in shops and Shazamed (the U.S. is particularly great for this, such random stuff makes it onto in-store radio)
- songs he’s heard on the radio in the house (mostly on [NTS](https://www.nts.live/), again pretty fractional, although some random stuff makes the grade like [this epic post-rock Papa M track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpvff5fX5IQ))
- game music (mostly Zelda, Mario Kart and Minecraft, some original, many covers and lots of them: albums are easy to discover and add so tend to bulk out)
- “more like this artist” and searches on fairly arbitrary strings (from car names to slang) in Apple Music
- songs featured in YouTube vids (so so many, mostly EDM flavour tracks from artists like [Camellia](https://cametek.bandcamp.com/) and [Clarx](https://soundcloud.com/clarxmusic))

I’m looking forward to finding out whether this magpie approach is an artefact of his age, or whether identifying with a specific genre is something that will be completely alien to him as he gets older.

If I were involved in putting out music in 2024 for exposure (which - much as I’ve enjoyed it in the past - I’m not) I’d focus my efforts on getting tracks into YouTube videos and forget about pretty much everything else.
