I had hoped to avoid blog-related busywork until I’d been posting for a few months but a few minor things were annoying me, so I thought them worth fixing.

## Permalinks

The [langer.tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/theme/325) theme I’m using only seems to create permalinks when Disqus comments are enabled. Weird. I may have accidentally broken it, I suppose. Anyway, fixed that.

## Markdown

I only realised that Tumblr supported Markdown for post creation when I stumbled over it during a settings trawl. Useful; now I can use Sublime Text to compose posts and avoid the slightly annoying Tumblr interface when possible.

## Syntax highlighting

I know I’ll need this soon. I had planned to use [Gists](https://gist.github.com/) in the short-term but after some [light](http://automateeverything.tumblr.com/post/20166142768/better-code-syntax-highlighting-w-highlight-js) [research](http://schneems.com/post/18551760180/give-tumblr-some-code), I thought that [highlight.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js) would be worth plumbing in.

```
10 PRINT "Hello, world"
20 GOTO 10
```

Lovely.
