Week 2 of going for some accountability. This week, I’m planning to do these three things:

1. Write a proposal, and reverse a proposal template out of it. Postponing this from [last week](/notes/superlifter-week-11/) has worked out pretty well, but more by luck than judgement.

2. Write a case study about the work we did for [BT Group](https://www.bt.com/) a while back. I don’t particularly like writing case studies. This is probably a good signal that this is worth doing.

3. A long list of content and marketing (but not content marketing) tasks. I try to avoid never-ending buckets of things, but there are enough relatively small, floating tasks here that it needs some attention.
