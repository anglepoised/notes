Busy for a while. In the meantime, a new low in lazy weblogging: all the links I've never slept with (or, um, weblogged).

Or, "I hoped this extended entry gubbins would come in handy at some point".

The [sound](http://howervision.com/arcade/sounds/videogames02/13-mooncresta.mp3 "Moon Cresta MP3") of [a wasted youth](http://www.klov.com/M/Moon_Cresta.html "Moon Cresta").

[National Theatre Summertime events 2002](http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/summertime/ "National Theatre Summertime events 2002").

[Blogamp](http://www.geocities.com/insanitydrops/blogamp/ "Blogamp: FTPs a text file ") and [DoSomething Winamp Plugin](http://www.oddsock.org/tools/dosomething/ "DoSomething").

[Random Duckman Quotes](http://www.creighton.edu/cgi-bin/ducker "Random Duckman Quotes") and the [Duckman FAQ](http://www.creighton.edu/~jduche/duckfaq.html "Duckman FAQ").

> Cornfed: You're aware that while it affords one the momentary illusion of satisfaction, the spewing of bile is never a permanent solution.

> Ajax: Hi dod, what ya doing?<br />
> Duckman (lighting a cigarette): Throwing my life away on an overpriced marketing phenomena that will leave me bedridden, tumorous and politically incorrect.<br />
> Ajax: Oh... I wish I had a hobby.<br />

[Plaid interview](http://www.freetimes.com/issues/1027/music-plaid.php3 "Cleveland Free Times: Plaid Takes The Hiss Out Of Electronic Music's Cutting Edge"):

> "In the States, we've had more interest in the last year or so," he continues. "Not so much that it's mainstream. We're not trying to make that happen. If one of our tracks got played in the background of Sex and the City or something like that, it's more likely that it could get wider recognition. That seems to be the only way electronic music gets wider recognition, if it's stuck on a coffee advert or something. That's not something we really like to do."

> "As Michael Caine says: 'There's been three gangster films come out of this country: good'uns. I made one, Hoskins made the other and we both made the third.' What was extraordinary about it at that time, was that we were just on the verge of Thatcherism. It was bang up to date. It hail the nail so firmly on the head, of where the Eighties were gonna go."

[Bimma Keez!](http://64.65.55.254/ubb/Forum1/HTML/002338.html "Trolling on the So Solid Crew boards")

[o9's](http://www.hyperreal.org/~chrism/o9/ "o9 Resource Page") [Tacklebox EP](http://www.forcedexposure.com/labels/mustdelicious.html "Forced Exposure: o9's Tacklebox EP") is (apparently) "a bold sonic statement inspired by the mysterious creatures and murky swamps of the Florida Everglades. This square-wave saturated bombshell was created using only an antiquated Amiga 500 and a rusty mixer." 'Mocassins Kissing' would certainly bear this out.

Went to [Late at the Tate](http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/programmes/lat.htm "Late at the Tate at Tate Britain"), which featured music from members of Fridge, Icarus, Gorodisch, Polly Paulusma & Rotozaza. Good fun, even though more than one group of artourists thought the band might be an exhibit.

[William Gibson, Modern boys and mobile girls](http://www.observer.co.uk/Print/0,3858,4163142,00.html "The Observer: Modern boys and mobile girls"):

> "Japanese culture is 'coded', in some wonderfully peculiar way that finds its nearest equivalent, I think, in English culture. And that is why the Japanese are subject to various kinds of Anglophilia, and vice versa. It accounts for the totemic significance, to the Japanese, of Burberry plaid, and for the number of Paul Smith outlets in Japan, and for much else besides. Both nations display a sort of fractal coherence of sign and symbol, all the way down into the weave of history. And Tokyo is very nearly, in its own way, as 'echoic' (to borrow Peter Ackroyd's term) a city as London."

Masamune Shirow (Ghost in the Shell) on [Black Magic M-66](http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Towers/1073/black.htm):

> "Since this is a bioroid-level civilization (whatever that means!), let's suppose that biotechnology permits production of robots that otherwise would be prohibitively expensive and impossibly difficult to repair or fine-tune if made of purely mechanical parts. Since the goal is not an exact copy of a human (bioroids are for military purposes, after all), photoelectronics and limited bio-brain applications provide optimum movement and spatial perception. The result is a "killer robot." But since this robot is no more that a byproduct of the human race, and is not recognized as an independent species, Asimov's "Three Laws of Robotics" do not apply."
