Foundation have announced details of next year&#8217;s All Tomorrow&#8217;s Parties festival, [The Directors Cut UK 2004][1]. There&#8217;s no word on the line-up so far (as is traditional) but three curators from previous UK ATP events ([Mogwai][2], [Tortoise][3] and [Shellac][4]) have been invited back to curate a day each.

This year&#8217;s ATP starts on the 4th of April and with Public Enemy, Aphex Twin, A Guy Called Gerald, El-P, The Fall, Venetian Snares and lots of people from Skam Records playing, it should be another stormer. Tickets officially sold out a while back, but some people are [still trading chalet spaces][5].

(Barely) related: [brief history of Camber][6].
