Nearly, anyway. For the past few years (very much literally) I've been trying to get back into the blogging habit but have been stymied each time by slow progress and a niggling feeling that I should be prioritising something else. I've managed to do some posting elsewhere, but not here, and here is home.

That all changed recently, when I managed to work out what I wanted to do and figured out how to do it.

I always thought the linklog ([back in the early 2000's](http://web.archive.org/web/20020324043042/http://anglepoised.com/)!) and tumblelog ([in the mid-to-late 2000's](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017033609/https://stream.anglepoised.com/)) approaches worked best for me. I was never particularly good at writing longer posts: the permanence got to me.
So I'm shooting for a fusion of [classic tumblelog](https://anarchaia.org/) (sorry, not microblog) and modifiable [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), with a sprinkling of [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/). Hopefully this approach will work and fit with the [internet is about to get weird again vibe](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-commentary/internet-future-about-to-get-weird-1234938403/).

I have - of course - made a rod for my own back by attempting to integrate posts from all my previous efforts. Fun, but all that file-wrangling takes time.

So far new tech is definitely helping. [Astro](https://astro.build/) is just right as a blogging tool for me: React-ish, but without the need to go all in (as I'd have to with Next). Relatively few niggles. The only feature I'm missing is [Hugo-like data templates](https://gohugo.io/templates/data-templates/). I would have liked something like that to store my [Pinboard bookmarks](https://pinboard.in/u:anglepoised/). I'm also getting some genuine use out of ChatGPT, particularly for file-wrangling. Surprising, but in a good way.

This new version is still going to look like crap for a long while, though, while I get the bones sorted out. Oh well!
