Last week, I decided to just go for one goal and compile and structure my notes from a proposal. There was more than I thought to this because research is hard to bound, but I got to a good stopping point. Then I did lots of other things. So based on a sample size of one, the “a thing a week” is achievable and probably better for mental health.

I also managed to avoid falling down a rabbit hole of looking at tools like [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). As fun as they look, putting everything in our org Notion instance was always going to be quicker.

I’m travelling on Friday and away for about a week, so need to be even less ambitious this week. My plan is to catch up on hanging writing-related tasks: reviewing reports and articles written by others, and getting some of my own increasingly-urgent writing done.

In the background:

- Second set of trade mark applications (this time it’s global).
- Continuing efforts to find a new lawyer.

## Media

- Book: I finished [Proxima](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18270328-proxima) and picked up [Ultima](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20632979-ultima), the next in Stephen Baxter’s series.
- Article: [Don Norman on how design fails older consumers](https://www.fastcompany.com/90338379/i-wrote-the-book-on-user-friendly-design-what-i-see-today-horrifies-me), from 2019. I immediately went out and bought a copy of [The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things) to replace the one I lost in a house move years ago.
- Music: [Creep Zone w/ James Pants & Marc Schaller 24.11.23](https://www.nts.live/shows/creepzone/episodes/creepzone-24th-november-2023). I stumbled over this while spelunking through the NTS site: a mix featuring many favourite 90’s bands, including Aerial M, Sebadoh, Slint, Duster, Eric’s Trip and Pavement.
