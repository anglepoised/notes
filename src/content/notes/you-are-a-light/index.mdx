Well, service would have resumed had I not been distracted by the edited highlights of [Gallipoli][1], [Karaoke Box Dai Chan][2], [Heaven][3], [The Goldhawk][4], [93 Feet East][5], [Bar Madrid][6] and [Ember][7].

Only regrets: not realising that Karaoke Box has a [selection of songs][8] from Monkey and getting far too many [minicabs][9].
