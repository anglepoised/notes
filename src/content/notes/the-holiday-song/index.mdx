Just back from [S&oacute;nar2004][1] in Barcelona. Well, bits of S&oacute;nar, anyway; turned up a few days late due to back trouble {/* the cause of which shall remain unstated */} and so only caught the Saturday evening events. The Fira

[Gran V&iacute;a M2][2] is an impressive space (especially when [filled][3] with 7000 maniacs dancing to Jeff Mills) and somewhere above street level on the [Nou de la Rambla][4] makes an excellent location for people-watching.
