The [Online Etymology Dictionary][1]:

> &#8220;I began this project after I looked one day for a dictionary of word origins online and found that there was none. There were dictionaries with definitions, some lists of slang words and their sources, and some sites that listed a few dozen of the strangest etymologies of English words. But there was no comprehensive list of the words we use every day &#8212; words like the and day &#8212; that told what they used to be before we got them.&#8221;

Also: [Word & Phrase Origins][2] (concerned mainly with the &#8216;stranger&#8217; etymologies).
