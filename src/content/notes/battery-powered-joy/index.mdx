Big [Uncharted Audio][1] update follows. [Cursor Miner&#8217;s][2] new album [Explosive Piece of Mind][3] ([Lo Recordings][4]) is in shops now ([Independent review][5]). The [Remote Control 12&#8243;][6] is also available. Remember the [Break-Fux-A-Thon competition][7]? Cursor Miner came top out of 70+ entries with [gravel sick Fructal beak][8] (MP3, 2,156Kb). Related: [Planet-Mu discussion][9].

Gig-wise, we have: Cursor Miner playing alongside Mira Calix, Plaid, [Suzie Sparkle][10] and Rough Trade DJs at the Warp/Seed/Skam/Spezialmaterial [Underlondonground 2][11] in the disused Aldwych tube station on August 2nd; LJ Kruzer and Kone-R at [Le Lieu Unique][12], Nantes on Friday 13th September and Kone-R/Cursor Miner at [The Monastery of Sound][13] in Normandy the day after.

In terms of actual, proper Uncharted Audio releases, the [LJ Kruzer][14]/[Council Flats of Kingsbury][15] [split 7&#8243;][16] is out in shops and [gathering press][17].
