## What am I doing now?

I'm living in Edinburgh with my partner and our 10-year-old son, visiting London regularly and Northern Virginia a few times a year.

This is what I'm trying to focus on:

- Helping my son learn how to ride a bike (fairly quickly: sometimes too quickly for my taste). Finished the "pretend it's a balance bike and zoom down the hill" stage. Next: the pedals go back on.
- Learning as much as I can about polite marketing, sales and networking for [day job](https://measured.co) purposes. Pretty happy with marketing, so next: read a book, either [The Lost Art of Closing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33358201-the-lost-art-of-closing) or [Let's Get Real or Let's Not Play](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/2862506).
- Trying to get a bit healthier. Next: re-engaging with [ZOE](https://joinzoe.com/) after a months-long break.
- Retrofitting this blog (very, very slowly), trying to finish the [digital garden + tumblelog](https://anglepoised.com/notes/blogging-again/) thought. Finished putting the basics of a content structure in place. Next: figure out how to bring in and push out content to other services.
- Retrofitting our tenement flat (even more slowly). Finished a full refurbishment of our front door (as opposed to the close door). Right now, trying to figure out how to recondition a lot of 1840's-era wood panelling.
- Figuring out how to I can re-engage with graphic design, drawing and art. No idea how to do this yet.

## What is this?

My [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. I try to update it every week ([check my progress](https://github.com/anglepoised/notes/commits/main/src/pages/now.md)).
