## What am I doing now?

I'm living in Edinburgh with my partner and 10-year-old son, visiting London regularly and Northern Virgina a few times a year.

This is what I'm trying to focus on right now:

- Retrofitting this blog (very, very slowly). Right now: trying to finish the [digital garden + tumblelog](https://anglepoised.com/notes/blogging-again/) thought.
- Retrofitting our tenement flat (even more slowly). Right now, trying to figure out how to recondition (a lot of) 1840's-era wood panelling.
- Helping my old son learn how to ride a bike (fairly quickly, sometimes too quickly for my taste). Right now: riding without pedals.
- Learning as much as I can about polite marketing, sales and networking for [day job](https://measured.co) purposes.
- Re-engaging with [ZOE](https://joinzoe.com/) after a months-long break.
- Figuring out how to I can re-engage with graphic design, drawing and art.

## What is this?

My [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. I try to update it every week.
