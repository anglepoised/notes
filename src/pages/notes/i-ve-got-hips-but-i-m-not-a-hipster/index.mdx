> Hipness is another thing you wouldn&rsquo;t have seen on the list 100 years ago. Or wouldn&rsquo;t you? What it means is to know what&rsquo;s what. So maybe it has simply replaced the component of social class that consisted of being &ldquo;au fait.&rdquo; That could explain why hipness seems particularly admired in London: it&rsquo;s version 2 of the traditional English delight in obscure codes that only insiders understand.

Lazy quoting; this is an excellent essay.
