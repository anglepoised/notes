[The LCD Rock and Roll Guide To London][1]:

> **King&#8217;s X, pronounced &#8220;King&#8217;s Cross&#8221;:** I have no idea whether the American Christian band takes its name from this neighborhood, but it&#8217;d be poetic justice if it did, as it&#8217;s one of the seediest, most drug- and hooker-ridden sections of London.
