The Guardian reports on [new music recognition technology][1].

> &#8220;I dial a number on an ordinary mobile phone. There is a pause of 10 to 15 seconds, then a voice on the phone tells me it is the Cranberries&#8217; Ode to My Family&#8230; his software can create a unique mathematical description of the song that can be checked against Shazam&#8217;s database.&#8221;

Might be fun to try it with some [Venetian Snares][2] tunes. Related: [Shazam Entertainment][3].
