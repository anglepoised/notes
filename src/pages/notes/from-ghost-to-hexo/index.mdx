I've moved this blog from [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) to [Hexo](https://hexo.io/).

Why? I [liked Ghost's interface](/notes/trying-out-ghost/) and it's very straightforward compared with WordPress, but it has too many moving parts. I like editing posts with a real editor, or directly on GitHub for speed. Being able to hook everything up to a CI service and use pull requests makes life easier. So it's [static site generators](http://staticgen.com/) all the way for me.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is easily the most popular SSG ([powering GitHub pages will do that](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/)) and it's a fine tool, but managing Ruby is a pain. The same goes for [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/): too Ruby. [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) looks like it could be fun, but I'm not quite ready to leap into Go.

So, Hexo. It's built with JavaScript and uses EJS and Swig for templating, so I can keep using the tooling I've been working on over the past couple of years. Getting started was fairly straightforward.

- I [installed Hexo locally](https://hexo.io/docs/index.html). It was as straightforward as installing any other npm package.
- My Ghost install was at 0.4.x, so I exported my posts using the [not-so-secret ugly debug tools](https://www.ghostforbeginners.com/backup-ghost-using-admin-ui/). It looks like [this menu has been renamed "Labs"](http://support.ghost.org/import-and-export-my-ghost-blog-settings-and-data/) in more recent versions of Ghost.
- I attempted to import my Ghost posts into Hexo with [`hexo-migrator-ghost`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo-migrator-ghost/). This failed with:

  ```bash
  $ hexo migrate ghost GhostData.json
  /Users/paul/Projects/anglepoised-notes/node_modules/hexo-migrator-ghost/index.js:92
        throw (e);
               ^
  TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined

  ```

  Sigh. I couldn't be bothered to debug this, so tried [sucking the posts out of the existing Ghost feed](https://hexo.io/docs/migration.html) with [`hexo-migrator-rss`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo-migrator-rss/). This worked. Hurrah!

- Mostly, anyway. I started the Hexo server with `hexo server` and noticed a few formatting issues. I have so few posts that repairing each by hand was the most straightforward way to fix this.
- Hacking the URL from `/year/month/post/` to `/year/month/` didn't work - no date-based archive pages. I should probably fix this at some point. Maybe [`hexo-generator-archive`](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-archive) will do it.
- Tags weren't appearing on posts. I manually added them to the Front Matter in each post, and added `tags: {% raw %}{{ tags }}{% endraw %}` to `scaffolds/post.md`.
- The share tool at the bottom of each post pointed to `http://yoursite.com/`. This prompted me to [sort out the config](https://hexo.io/docs/configuration.html). This was trivial. It's just YAML.
- The [default Hexo theme](https://hexo.io/hexo-theme-landscape/) is a bit meh. I tried a couple from the [theme directory](https://hexo.io/themes/), but they didn't work for me. There are many more themes in [this old list](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/wiki/Themes), but it's not clear whether they'd work properly with the latest version or not. So, another thing to fix later.
- I like favicons. It took me a while to work out that the favicon filename is set in the theme's `_config.yml` and the file itself should be dropped into the `/source` directory.
- The feed wasn't being generated. I had to install [`hexo-generator-feed`](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-feed) and update `_config.yml` to get this working.

  ```yaml
  feed:
    type: atom
    path: atom.xml
    limit: 20
  ```

- I like using [npm as a build tool](http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/) so I made `npm start` run `hexo server`. Small beginnings.

I still have plenty of things I'd like to do (CI! Linting Markdown! Using PostCSS!) but I'm please that getting from zero to minimum viable blog was this straightforward.
