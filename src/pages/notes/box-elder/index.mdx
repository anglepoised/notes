[Pierced man told to wear box on his head][1]:

> The accountant said he would only reconsider if Mr Lynch wore a cardboard box over his head, did something about his smell and donated &pound;100 to Greenpeace, Amnesty International, Christian Aid or the Tear Fund.
>
> &#8220;If it made him feel any better, I would wear a box over my head too&#8221;, added Mr MacDougall.

This was front page news in Harpenden this week. I&#8217;m not sure why it makes me laugh so much, but it&#8217;s kind of like having [The Framley Examiner][2] as a local rag.
