I&#8217;d still like to know why [Cai Guo-Qiang&#8217;s][1] [&#8216;Ye Gong Hao Long&#8217;][2] (Mr Ye who loves dragons) firework explosion project at Tate Modern on 31st January went so badly wrong. The Tate and Egg Live site is [still (unsurprisingly) silent][3] on the matter and [the only article mentioning the fiasco][4] isn&#8217;t all that useful; anyone got the skinny on why it was such a damp squib?
