[Art of Perception][1], a German record label, have been busy releasing a series of 12&#8243;s that attempt to provide soundtracks for the various races in the [Warhammer 40K universe][2]. Artists featured include Jimi Tenor, Kitbuilders, Bochum Welt, Rude Solo (aka Andy Weatherall and Keith Tenniswood) and Mike Ink. Tedious, turn-based tabletop battles ahoy. Blurb from the [Forced Exposure catalogue][3]:

> &#8220;The concept of &#8216;Art of Perception&#8217; is to add soundtracks to subjects from the fields of art and media. The first project &#8216;The Sound of Warhammer 40.000&#8217; is a co-operation with the Nottingham based creative company Games Workshop, best known for fantasy and science fiction miniature battle games such as Warhammer, Warhammer 40.000, Necromunda. The idea is to create a limited twelve-part vinyl series in co-operation with internationally established electronic musicians&#8230; Each artist conducts a unique theme for a different type of species &#8211; a musical interpretation of a fantastic world from the Warhammer 40.000 universe.&#8221;
