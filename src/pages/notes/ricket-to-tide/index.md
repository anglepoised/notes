Anglepoised presents LJ Kruzer&#8217;s [Since I Took A Taxi][1] (MP3, 5,828k) &#8211; a stunning reworking of Bob James&#8217; Angela (Theme from &#8220;Taxi&#8221;). Praise: &#8220;Ooh. It&#8217;s like&#8230; iffff&#8230; Harrison Ford had taken a taxi in Blade Runner!&#8221; ([orbyn][2]), &#8220;That&#8217;s excellent!&#8221; ([headlessness][3]).
