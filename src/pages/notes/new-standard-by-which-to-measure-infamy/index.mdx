William Burroughs&#8217; [Thanksgiving Prayer][1] from 1990&#8217;s [Dead City Radio][2]. Imagine a link to a recording of the track right about here {/* subtle as a brick in a half-sock: http://everythingisnt.com/images/Burroughs-Thanksgiving.mp3  - sorry, Everything Isn't! */}; it was tricky to find.
