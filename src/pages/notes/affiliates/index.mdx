description: "An argument with myself about modern blogging culture."

I've been arguing with myself again. Should I use affiliate links when I post here? If I do, should I identify them as such? And if so, how should I make it clear which links are affiliate links and which aren't? With asterisks? A different link colour? A comment after each? And will people think less of me for trying to earn a few quid when writing about services like [FreeAgent](http://fre.ag/43hj1tks)<sup>\*</sup>? Will they question my objectivity?

And then I realised: it's 2014, not 1999. Nobody cares either way. I don't care. Endless discussions about blogging etiquette don't really happen any more.

So. [Less worrying](https://medium.com/p/52bc4be9e7c1). More doing.

And affiliate links. Maybe.
