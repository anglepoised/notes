The Village Voice [interview Haruki Murakami][1] about his recently published short story collection [After the Quake][2] and his 10th novel, Kafka on the Shore:

> &#8220;[The novel] has already sold 200,000 copies in Japan, he tells me, and he is responding directly to readers via a special Web site ([www.kafkaontheshore.com][3]). Told in the voice of a 15-year-old runaway in a chaotic world of falling fish and incipient terror, Kafka interweaves a boy&#8217;s life with that of a Japanese World War II veteran rendered illiterate by a coma, who upon partial recovery can communicate only with cats. The title is meant to represent the borderline between the conscious and the unconscious, land and sea, living and dead. &#8216;It&#8217;s my &#8216;road movie&#8217; novel,&#8217; Murakami says. &#8216;The characters are always moving, in Japan and in the nowhere-land, the underground. They live in a world of violence, and they know they have to fight it.'&#8221;
