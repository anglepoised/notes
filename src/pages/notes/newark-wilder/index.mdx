The Guardian [profiles Paul Auster][1].

> &#8220;Poet Ann Lauterbach, who has known Auster since the late 1970s, takes a different view: &#8216;Part of the secret of Paul&#8217;s success is that his books have a neat kind of intellectual flattery, complimenting the reader with their quasi-philosophical games.&#8217; Her criticism echoes an article printed in Atlantic Monthly last year which, with impressive thoroughness, attacked the reputations of American writers including Don DeLillo, E Annie Proulx and David Guterson. Particular violence was reserved for Auster: &#8216;Auster knows the prime rule of pseudo-intellectual writing,&#8217; wrote BR Myers. &#8216;The harder it is to be pinned down on any idea, the easier it is to conceal that one has no ideas at all.'&#8221;
