> The damage is done. Beacon and tracking regimes like it violate the unwritten soc-site covenant: They don&rsquo;t care who you think you are or who you&rsquo;d like other people to think you are. They barely glance at your meticulously managed profile — Chabon on the nightstand, Beirut on the iPod, gut carefully sucked in. Instead, they tail you, dissecting you site by site, purchase by purchase.
