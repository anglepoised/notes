[Taoism or Daoism][1]?

> &#8220;The difference in spelling and pronunciation exists because &#8220;Taoism&#8221;/&#8221;Daoism&#8221; are formed from a Chinese word which can be transliterated either as &#8220;Tao&#8221;, using the older Wade-Giles transliteration system, or &#8220;Dao&#8221;, using the newer and more preferred pinyin scheme for the romanization of Chinese.&#8221;
