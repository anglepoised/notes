This month has been all about writing reports, attending meetings and avoiding paper as much as possible, so my obvious [donationware](/notes/donationware/) choice for this month is [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/).

It’s is a fork of the original [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/), a note-keeping app. Sort of. It’s more complicated than that, though. And more straightforward. Inevitably.

> [Notational Velocity] is an attempt to loosen the mental blockages to recording information and to scrape away the tartar of convention that handicaps its retrieval. The solution is by nature nonconformist.

I’d been using the original NV for a couple of years but it was seeing very little developer love, so when I switching to a new machine a few weeks ago, I installed nvALT. It has some handy additional features, including [MarkDown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) and [Textile](http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/) support, a preview window and “really cool scrollbars”.

Highly recommended.
