<i>Son:</i> Daddy, Daddy! Look at the diagonal bracing on the torsion rods!
<br />
<i>Father:</i> Aye, son. But not just that &#8211; I think you&#8217;ll find on
descending the six-lane slide that the rolled steel joists have been galvanised
for protection.
<br />
<i>Son:</i> Brilliaaaant!
<br />
<i>Father:</i> Aye. But make sure to hold tight to the aluminium angle-supported
safety rail while you ascend the staircase, son, or you&#8217;ll fall, and the
pigment flowing forth from your cracked head certainly won&#8217;t enhance your
appearance.
