Last year (last year!) I gave a quick talk about [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) at [HMTL](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ohskylab/8841052813/). And then promptly forgot to put the accompanying presentation in a useful location. So, here it is: [Vagrant. It's quite good.](http://anglepoised.github.io/hmtl-vagrant-talk/)

It doesn't cover some of newer Vagrant features like the [Ansible Provisioner](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/ansible.html), [Docker-based environments](https://www.vagrantup.com/blog/feature-preview-vagrant-1-6-docker-dev-environments.html) and [Vagrant Cloud](https://vagrantcloud.com/) but it works as a decent explanation of what Vagrant is and why one might want to consider using it. I think.

The presentation was put together using the entertaining [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/).
