Lyrics from Sushi K&#8217;s rap.

> I'm Sushi K and I'm here to say<br />
> I like to rap in a different way<br />
>
> Look out Number One in every city<br />
> Sushi K rap has all most pretty<br />
>
> My special talking of remarkable words<br />
> Is not the sterotyped bucktooth nerd<br />
>
> My hair is big as a galaxy<br />
> Cause I attain greater technology<br />
>
> I like to rap about sweetened romance<br />
> My fond ambition is of your pants<br />
>
> So here is of special remarkable way<br />
> Of this fellow raps named Sushi K<br />
>
> The Nipponese talking phenomenon<br />
> Like samurai sword his sharpened tongue<br />
>
> Who raps the East Asia and the Pacific<br />
> Prosperity Sphere, to be specific<br />
>
> Sarariman on subway listen<br />
> For Sushi K like nuclear fission<br />
>
> Fire breathing lizard Gojiro<br />
> He my always big-time hero<br />
>
> His mutant rap burn down whole block<br />
> Start investing now Sushi K stock<br />
>
> It on Nikkei stock exchange<br />
> Waxes; other rappers wane<br />
>
> Best investment, make my day<br />
> Corporation Sushi K<br />
>
> Coming to America now<br />
> Rappers trying to start a row<br />
>
> Say "Stay in Japan, please, listen!<br />
> We can't handle competition!"<br />
>
> U.S. rappers booin' and hissin'<br />
> Ask for rap protectionism<br />
>
> They afraid of Sushi K<br />
> Cause their audience go away<br />
>
> He got chill financial backin'<br />
> Give those U.S. rappers a smackin'<br />
>
> Sushi K concert machine<br />
> Fast efficient super clean<br />
>
> Run like clockwork in a watch<br />
> Kick old rappers in the crotch<br />
>
> He learn English total immersion<br />
> English/Japanese be mergin'<br />
>
> Into super combination<br />
> So can have fans in every nation<br />
>
> Hong Kong they speak English too<br />
> Yearn of rappers just like you<br />
>
> Anglophones who live down under<br />
> Sooner later start to wonder<br />
>
> When they get their own rap star<br />
> Tired of rappers from afar<br />
>
> So I will get big radio traffic<br />
> When you look at demographic<br />
>
> Sushi K research statistic<br />
> Make big future look ballistic<br />
>
> Speed of Sushi K growth stock<br />
> Put U.S. rappers into shock<br />
