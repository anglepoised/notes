> We won&rsquo;t need to spend all our time pounding keys and clicking mice inside our web browsers. Instead, we&rsquo;re going to end up with the internet smearing itself all over the world around us, visible at first in glimpses through enchanted windows, and then possibly through glasses, or contact lenses, with embedded projection displays.
