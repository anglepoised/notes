[Wheel of Stars][1]

> &ldquo;A musical clock made of stars. To make this, I downloaded public data from Hipparcos, a satellite launched by the European Space Agency in 1989 that accurately measured over a hundred thousand stars. The data I downloaded contains position, parallax, magnitude, and color information, among other things. I used this information to plot the brightest stars, and cause them to revolve about Polaris (the North Star) very slowly, as the stars appear to do. Like the night sky, this is a sidereal time clock &ndash; it takes nearly 24 hours for the stars to fully rotate.&rdquo;
