[Double Fold][1], an album from [Scanner][2] inspired by the [Nicholson Baker book][3] of the same name.

> Sourcing sounds from his own domestic tape archive and processing them digitally Scanner explores his own brittle sound diary, producing a series of contrasting moods that slip and slide around one another, yet never losing grip of the measure. Double Fold scatters beats into a warm seductive groove, hard digital lock grooves melding into rhythms that edge under the floorboards whilst pixellated abstraction tattoos it&#8217;s way across the surface.
