A quote in an article by [Oliver Burkeman](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/01/change-your-life-oliver-burkeman-bf-skinner) caught my eye a while back:

> Eyal urges businesses to think ethically. (Creating addictive products you wouldn't use yourself, he says, "is called exploitation".)

I tracked down the original quote to Nir Eyal's 2012 post, [The Morality of Manipulation](http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/07/the-art-of-manipulation.html):

> Creating a product that the designer does not believe improves the userâ€™s life and which the maker would not use is exploitation.

Obvious, but easy to forget, and a handy lodestar.
