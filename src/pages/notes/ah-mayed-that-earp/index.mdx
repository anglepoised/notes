The Guardian [interviews Donna Tartt][1] about [The Little Friend][2], her latest novel, and attempts to clear up some of the myths and mysteries surrounding the 10 years since the release of [The Secret History][3].

> &#8220;Was she making fun of me? (One thinks of Carraway of Gatsby: &#8216;For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg&#8230; My incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines.&#8217; And Vanity Fair called her &#8216;a character of her own fictive creation&#8217;.) Does she see herself like Henry in The Secret History, &#8216;a propagandist, routinely withholding information, leaking it only when it served his purpose&#8217;? Another (former) friend says that &#8216;she seems to have a natural love of intrigue&#8217;, and you wonder if this myth-making and mysterious self-creation are to protect the creative process, or are just her being a storyteller. Self-consciously writerly.&#8221;
