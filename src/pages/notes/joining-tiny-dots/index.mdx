Pondering the original source of the phrase &#8220;and besides, the wench is dead&#8221; after noticing it in the author&#8217;s notes for Walter Tevis&#8217; [The Hustler][1] and the William Burroughs sketch [Dr. Benway Operates][2].

Turns out it&#8217;s from Christopher Marlowe&#8217;s [The Jew of Malta][3].
