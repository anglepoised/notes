> Here&rsquo;s a hint: if I wanted to spend my time marketing my books I&rsquo;d have gone into marketing. I&rsquo;m a writer. Every hour spent on marketing activities is an hour spent not writing. Ditto editing, proofreading, commissioning cover art, and so on. This is what I have publishers for. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;division of labour&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s why self-publishing — unless you&rsquo;re an instinctive sales/marketing genius — is a Really Bad Idea™ for most writers.
