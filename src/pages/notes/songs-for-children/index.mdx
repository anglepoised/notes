The new [Belle and Sebastian][1] album, Storytelling, is set for a [June 3rd release][2].

> &#8220;The album is compiled of songs that were written throughout 2001 for Todd Solondz&#8217;s film &#8220;[Storytelling][3]&#8220;, some featuring in the film and others written about the film after its completion.&#8221;

Here&#8217;s hoping it&#8217;s of better quality than the most recent single.
