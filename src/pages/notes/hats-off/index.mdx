[The Zebra Face cartoons][1], from [Invisible Spies][2].

> &#8220;Armed with only the face of a Zebra, and a diabetic mouth organ wielding side-kick, Zebra Face embarks on a series of eliptical adventures, battle rhyming with a host of baddies most of which boast similarly useless superhero characteristics, and who eventually succumb to Zebra Faces&#8217; supreme rhyming abilities and stripy body.&#8221;
