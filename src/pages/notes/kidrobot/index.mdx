[Premium collectible Urban-style action figures][1] for sale (from those nice people at [Minidisco][2]).

> &#8220;The figures we&#8217;ve got are designed by an emerging group of underground artists in Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S. who fuse urban street culture and hip-hop style with amazing results. Call it HK Vinyl, Urban Vinyl, or Hong Kong Style- however you describe it, this is some of the coolest stuff we&#8217;ve ever seen.&#8221;

The [Michael Lau][3] and [Eric So][4] figures are excellent.
