> The problem with `[timeline`] roadmaps is that they are linear and one-dimensional. They suggest that the product team knows exactly what needs to be done in the future, and that itâ€™s only a matter of correct estimation and timely execution. But these are in fact release plans, not product roadmaps. They do not reflect the core concepts of modern product development, such as uncertainty, discovery and small pivots.
