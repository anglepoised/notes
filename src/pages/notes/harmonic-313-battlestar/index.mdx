[Harmonic 313 &#8211; Battlestar][1].

> Shot stereoscopically (i.e. on 2 identical cameras separated in space to mimic 2 eyes) the clip uses a flicking technique that was inspired by 2 frame animations of 3D photos.
>
> In this technique, a sense of depth is provided to the footage by changing between the left and right eye views between each frame. In moving footage, not only does it add a sense of depth but also a definite intensity and alternative reality to each scene. For different people, it can create a curious mental floatiness in some shots.
