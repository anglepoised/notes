Midnight Eye&#8217;s review of Katsuyuki Motohiro&#8217;s botched-heist film [Space Travelers][1]:

> &#8220;Space Travelers can be appreciated for its inventive approach to creating a feature that integrates live action with impressive animated sequences&#8230; As various events unfold inside the bank, Fujimoto notices subtle idiosyncrasies in the actions of everyone in the main foyer of the bank corresponding to each of the personalities of the main characters in his favourite anime. This dropping of the proverbial penny paves the way for much rediscovery via each of them taking on the persona of a character from the Space Travelers anime.&#8221;
