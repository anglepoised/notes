[muxtape][1]:

> Muxtape now supports [Last.fm][2] scrobbling. Go to the [settings page][3] and click the “link my Last.fm account” button. After you authorize Muxtape, songs will be recorded into your Last.fm listening history just like any other app (scrobble occurs halfway through the song or after 240 seconds, whichever comes first)
