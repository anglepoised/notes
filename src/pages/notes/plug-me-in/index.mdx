Stuck for something to do this Thursday evening? Of course not. After all, you&#8217;re the busy, thrusting, socially well-endowed type! However, should you find yourself at a loose end, you could do much worse than popping along to [sonomu presents&#8230;#003][1] at the [Embassy Bar in Islington][2] for a &#8220;heady mixture of rocktronica, pop and plucky old electro&#8221; with our very own [Kone-R][3], as well as the lovely sonomu residents. Details for the unregistered:

8pm-11pm (2002/04/18)
