[Babel Guides][1]: a new site for world literature in translation. As well as information about Babel&#8217;s guides to French, German, Dutch and Flemish, Brazilian and Scandinavian literature (among others), the site features a forum and 1000+ book reviews.

The [Guide to South Asia][2] is in preparation (but there&#8217;s still no sign of a Japanese guide).
