The Guardian [profiles William Gibson][1]:

> &#8220;Gibson&#8217;s fiction has always been concerned with the problem of how people make sense of a world that has been irreparably changed by new technology [&#8230;] What happens to those characters,&#8221; Gibson maintains, &#8220;illustrates the impact of technology on society, and I find myself thinking sometimes that there isn&#8217;t anything other than the impact of technology on society &#8211; possibly that has been more significant historically than any sort of political thought, in terms of bringing us to where we are now.&#8221;
