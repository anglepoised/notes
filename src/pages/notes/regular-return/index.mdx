[The Bristol Art Library][1] is the smallest public lending library in the world, is &#8220;housed in a wooden cabinet the size of a small suitcase&#8221; and contains 170 books on &#8220;a wide range of subjects, from palaeontology to astronomy&#8221;. It&#8217;s making a stop in London [this week][2].
