[V/Vm Test Records][1] are one of those nice record labels, the kind that publish the bulk of their nutty [back catalogue][2] as mp3s after they&#8217;ve been deleted. Artists include Kid 606, Boards of Canada (under their Hell Interface moniker), Goodiepal and the wonderfully named Alien Porno Midgets.
