Excerpt from Helen Cooper&#8217;s [A Chaucerian Year][1].

> &#8220;Odd things happen to the hormones in May; and although people did not know about hormones, they were entirely familiar with their symptoms&#8230; but May was not entirely good. Some days in the medieval calendar were believed to bring bad luck, and early May is recurrently dangerous.&#8221;
