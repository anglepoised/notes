Creating a distributed tag-based radio using Last.fm.

> All you need to do is to tag the track you want to share "woopwoop" in your Last.fm player or on the Last.fm website. Then, to listen to WoopWoop radio, just browse for the tag (again, either on the site or in your Last.fm player). (via [WoopWoop -- Groups at Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/group/WoopWoop/))
