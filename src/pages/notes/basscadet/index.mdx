ATP have confirmed that [Autechre][1] will curate next year&#8217;s [All Tomorrow&#8217;s Parties][2] in the UK (as [mentioned last month][3]).

No line-up announced yet; here&#8217;s hoping it&#8217;s as diverse as last year&#8217;s excellent [Tortoise-curated festival][4] and not as wilfully guitar-centric as this year&#8217;s [Shellac offering][5]. Related: [UK music festival info][6].
