[National Trust: The Album](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-global/w-news/w-latest_news/w-news-national-trust-the-album.htm):

> The 33-minute recording titled National Trust: The Album takes the listener on an audio journey around Britain from the sounds of lapping of waves against the shores of Brownsea Island in Dorset to birdsong at Belton House in Lincolnshire and the sounds of gardeners at work at Powis Castle in Powys.
