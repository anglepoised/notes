[The Mystery of Black Devil &#8211; eMusic Spotlight][1]

> A few years ago, the Rephlex label released a record called Disco Club that had black-crack collectors all atwitter over its white-hot machine drumming, chunky percussion loops and garbled synthesizers, sounding like an impish (and possibly evil) cousin to Giorgio Moroder. The artist, one Black Devil, was so little known that many listeners assumed it must be the work of one of Rephlex&rsquo;s own stable â€” possibly Luke Vibert, who had just recorded his own retro-sounding tribute to Italo disco under a new pseudonym, Kerrier District. But Disco Club was soon deemed exactly what it seemed to be: a lost classic from 1978, pieced together from tape loops, rickety gear and session drumming.
