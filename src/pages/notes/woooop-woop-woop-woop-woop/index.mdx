[What&#8217;s the deal with New York and New Jersey][1]?

> Much like the television families on &#8220;Dynasty&#8221; and &#8220;Dallas,&#8221; tension between the two jurisdictions never ceases; only the issues change. In the past decade, the rivalry between the City of New York and the New Jersey communities across the Hudson has broadened to include a variety of issues other than competition for ocean cargo. The opposing camps have waged a constant struggle over issues such as competition for jobs, a \$40 million Urban Development Action Grant for Jersey City, Westway, ocean dumping by New York City, and the movement of back offices from Manhattan.

Blame binge-watching [Futurama][2] and [The Sopranos][3].
