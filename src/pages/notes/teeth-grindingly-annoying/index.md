> I don&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;explore the interface&rdquo;. I want to get in, do my shit and get out again. If you think forcing users to explore the interface is such a good idea, try ripping the labels off all the cans of food in your cupboard. A couple of meals of cat-food, chilli and peaches should demonstrate exactly how &ldquo;fun&rdquo; this is.
