The National Post on [the problems with the Star Wars prequels][1]. In short: where&#8217;s the Han Solo types?

> &#8220;Part of the magic of the first Star Wars was that Solo (despite his name) made a perfect bookend to Luke &#8211; he tempered Luke&#8217;s wide-eyed earnestness with a jaded, seen-it-all nonchalance. Kids who marveled at the first Star Wars tended to align themselves as either Luke fans or Han fans &#8211; and while no formal study was taken, I&#8217;d wager the large majority of those kids saw themselves as budding, Solo-style space pirates rather than as neophyte Jedi masters.&#8221;
