From [The History of Nipper and His Master&#8217;s Voice][1]:

> In Liverpool Nipper discovered the Phonograph, a cylinder recording and playing machine and Francis Barraud &#8220;often noticed how puzzled he was to make out where the voice came from&#8221;. This scene must have been indelibly printed in Barraud&#8217;s brain, for it was three years after Nipper died that he committed it to canvas.
