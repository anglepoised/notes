The Times on the [commercial hijacking of Prague][1].

> &#8220;Yet precisely because Prague has such a miraculously preserved centre &#8211; a time-capsule, unravaged by war, oppression or the high-rise architects who have trampled over the sensibilities of every other world capital &#8211; one feels all the more acutely the tensions created by the abrupt westernisation of the past 13 years.&#8221;
