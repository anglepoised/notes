[McFilter: A Taste of TED on DVD][1]

> There are six talks on the DVD. I picked ones that I enjoyed watching and that seem to be well thought of on the web:
>
> 1.  Dan Gilbert asks “Why are we happy?”
> 2.  Malcolm Gladwell on spaghetti sauce
> 3.  Sir Ken Robinson say schools kill creativity
> 4.  Hans Rosling shows the best stats you’ve ever seen
> 5.  Barry Schwartz on the paradox of choice
> 6.  Gever Tulley on five dangerous things for kids
