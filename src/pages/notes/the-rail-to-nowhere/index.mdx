> The question &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo; has been asked about Berney Arms station ever since its creation in the 1840s. One might assume the pub was the reason for putting it there, but that isn&rsquo;t the case. It is there because Thomas Trench Berney, who owned the land, was ready to sell to the railway company only on the condition that a station be put there &ldquo;in perpetuity&rdquo;.
