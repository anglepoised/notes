After 72 years, the [Dictionary of Middle English is finally finished][1].

> &#8220;Now, for the first time, what was being spoken in the streets and alehouses of London in about the year 1400 has been fastidiously catalogued. The vocabulary of Middle English, as resurrected in Middle America, starts at &#8220;abaciste&#8221; (someone who uses an abacus) and runs all the way to &#8220;zucarine&#8221; (sugar-like).&#8221;
