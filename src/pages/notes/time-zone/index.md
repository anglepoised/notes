[The Guardian&#8217;s Charlie Porter on obsession-inducing 24][1].

> &#8220;Most of us never expected to get caught up in a series that covers essentially the same ground as an average Tom Clancy novel &#8230; but in 24, where a clock at the bottom of the screen proves that in each episode we see an hour&#8217;s worth of real-time action, the subject matter is almost irrelevant &#8211; we&#8217;d watch golf if it was done with the same suspense.&#8221;
