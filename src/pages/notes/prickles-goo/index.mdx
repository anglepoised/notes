[Prickles & Goo: Alan Watts Trey Parker Matt Stone South Park][1].

> This is one of several animated short films set to the audio recordings of philosopher Alan Watts (1915 &ndash; 1973). From what I can tell, the animations were made several years ago and were produced by the makers of South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone.
