> It&rsquo;s better to do something than to do nothing. Even lolcats, even cute pictures of kittens made even cuter with the addition of cute captions, hold out an invitation to participation. When you see a lolcat, one of the things it says to the viewer is, &ldquo;If you have some sans-serif fonts on your computer, you can play this game, too.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s message&ndash;I can do that, too&ndash;is a big change. This is something that people in the media world don&rsquo;t understand.
