> The slow flow of corporate will carried me through long weeks of no thought. Lacking a will of my own, I hosted the urges of the organization. This happens very easily. You start by controlling your desires, then deferring gratification and before you know it you&rsquo;ve lost the ability to want altogether. Other people want for you. Friends, employers, wives, children. I was a vessel for other people&rsquo;s longing.
