Have been busy with work one, work two, work three, setting up a company, moving flat, getting slightly older and sundry other bits. Thanks for being patient; normal patchy service will resume as soon as the Telewest man comes round and sorts the plumbing out. Normal social operations will resume after this month&#8217;s eagerly-awaited Smith-Calder nuptials.
