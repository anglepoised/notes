Jam, Chris Morris&#8217; TV follow-up to the [Blue Jam Radio 1 show][1], is being [released on DVD][2] in April. The extra features (including &#8216;Undeleted Scenes&#8217;, &#8216;Programme 6 speeded up and then slowed again to original duration&#8217;, &#8216;1st 19 seconds of programme 5&#8217; and &#8216;Adam & Joe&#8217;s Goitre&#8217;) sound well worth waiting for.
