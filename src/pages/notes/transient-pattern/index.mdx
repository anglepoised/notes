Elihu Vedder&#8217;s [drawings for the Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t of Omar Khayy&aacute;m][1]:

> Vedder&#8217;s Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t set the standard for the artist-designed book in America and England. Vedder created designs for the entire book &#8212; its cover and lining paper, its compelling drawings, and its eccentric hand-drawn letters.

> The rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t (the plural form of quatrain, or a verse unit of four lines) were written around 1120 by the Persian mathematician, astronomer, and poet Omar Khayy&aacute;m. He left upwards of 1,000 epigrams on the transience of existence and the uselessness of mathematics, science, or religion to untangle the knotted meaning of life.
