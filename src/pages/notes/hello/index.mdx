Right, blogging again. This time it’s vaguely technical.

Towards the end of 2011 I decided to spend more time learning about all the exciting new things floating about and attempt some serious improvements to my development workflow. I also thought that I might as well attempt to document everything as I do so.

So, this is my second attempt at the documentation bit.

On my first I got as far as setting up and deploying [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) before realising that it depends on a stack that I have no intention of getting serious with and also solves a couple of problems (ownership of content and the performance-enhancing use of flat files) that I don’t really have.

I spent a while considering [scriptogr.am](http://scriptogr.am/). It looks lovely but - while I’m not _that_ bothered about my content - it’s a little [too free](http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/12/don_t_be_a_free_user/) for me right now. Start charging!

So, [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com/) it is. Their terms could change for the worse or they could be acquired and shut everything down. I think that’s a marginal risk, though. I’m willing to accept it in return for greater convenience and a light dusting of social.

Off we go, then.
