<i>Fazal:</i> its amazing how out of sync teh web actually is
<br />
<i>Fazal:</i> browsers are pretty much the reason for all our woes
<br />
<i>Fazal:</i> and we constantly have to innovate and hack to compensate
<br />
<i>Paul:</i> you could replace &#8220;browsers&#8221; with project managers
<br />
<i>Paul:</i> or clients
<br />
