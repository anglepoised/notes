Last week (last week!) I was going to give a quick talk about [Codeship](https://codeship.io/) at [HMTL](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ohskylab/8841052813/). However, events conspired against me and I couldn't attend. And there probably wouldn't have been time to do it, what with all the other excellent-sounding talks on the bill. But I thought I'd put the slides up anyway: [Using Codeship for Continuous Integration and Deployment.](http://anglepoised.github.io/hmtl-codeship-talk/)

The presentation put together using the enticing [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/).
