How did I miss this? [Logan&#8217;s Sanctuary][1] is the soundtrack to an imaginary [Logan&#8217;s Run][2] sequel.

> &#8220;Inspired by a Seventies post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller, Roger Joseph Manning Jr. and Brian Reitzell painstakingly created the soundtrack to it&#8217;s imaginary sequel. The album&#8217;s futuristic cover art was designed by Mike Mills who is best known for his work with Air, Beastie Boys and Pulp.&#8221;

A preview track (the excellent &#8216;Metropia&#8217;) is available from [Emperor Norton][3], and sounds a little like Virgin Suicides era Air covering Jeff Wayne&#8217;s War of the Worlds.
