Been busy and having connection issues {/* Aside from the pipe(s) at work(s)... but how *do* people manage to find the time to toss about with AIM, idle surfing etc when they're supposed to be working? And what's the point? */} but back in the game, for all that&#8217;s worth. Highlights of the past few weeks:

- [Hung, Drawn and Quartered][1], including [Cursor Miner&#8217;s][2] storming set with [Fuel Records][3] {/* who have an amusing habit of bringing their Dodge Challenger with 'inbuilt orgasm frequency speakers' along to TG - destined to happen with one of Mr Miner's more mental sets at some point in the near future, if I have my way */} at The Pool and Si Begg, u-ziq, Cylob and others at Aquarium.

  {/* don't forget your cossie */}

- [Kings Have Long Arms][4] (whose re-recorded version of Rock and Roll is Dead with Phil Oakey on vocals seems to be [going down well][5]) supporting [I Am Kloot][6]. {/* Ta fer tickets, Carol! Kings were great and well worth the non-existent price of admission, but I Am Kloot seemed a tad lifeless after that, so we left sharpish and abused Sam's hospitality/local. Again. */}

- [John Hegley][7], [Simon Munnery][8] and friends doing drunken, impromptu comedy at The Old Red Lion for [Peace One Day][9].
- Our flatwarming. {/* messy fun. photos soon pending legal advice. */}

- Food and cocktails at the bizarre and empty [LMNT][10] (lack of patronage may have been something to do with the extreme heat that day, but could&#8217;ve been absinthe-related delusion).
- [Bill Bailey][11]. {/* Thanks for the tickets, Toni. Wish you'd have come, mind */}

- Max Tundra, Mouse on Mars and Fourtet for the Domino Records [Worlds of Possibility][12] at The End.

&#8230;and some other stuff too, I think. {/* sorry, know. inappropriate. */} Missed lots of things recently due to work commitments (apologies to respective parties) and may continue to do so over the next month for the same reasons, but please try anyway; lacking willpower, as ever.
