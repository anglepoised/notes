[The Right to Know][1] from the [Information Commissioner][2] purports to &#8220;give information on how to access files and records held on you by people and organisations&#8221; but is essentially just a link to a 9-page <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> about how to exercise your right of access under the Data Protection Act. Disappointing.
