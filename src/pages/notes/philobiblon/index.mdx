[The Independent on Foyles][1], [London&#8217;s most eccentric large bookshop][2].

> For decades, Foyles has been a shopper&#8217;s nightmare, with miles and miles of haphazardly arranged titles, non-English-speaking student staff, and a payment system apparently designed by a Victorian lunatic. &#8220;It was a byword for dreadful bookselling,&#8221; said Nicholas Clee, editor of The Bookseller. &#8220;They never answered the phone, the assistants never knew anything, and were hired and fired in six months. You could never find any book you wanted.&#8221;
