> Top Cat! Do you remember it? Top Cat! Well, they&rsquo;ve dismembered it. Cartoon cats who&rsquo;re breaking the law — we loved it on TV, but the film version&rsquo;s poor. Top Cat! The indisputable worst film of the year! The animation&rsquo;s bad, and the script is just sad, I think we&rsquo;ve all been had by – Top Cat!
