[John Callaghan &#8211; Loudhailer][1].

> Recorded as part of One & Other. This was Anthony Gormley&rsquo;s piece where a member of the British public would have one hour on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square to do whatever they wanted. I decided to film a music video.
>
> My hour was between 2 and 3pm on October the 2nd 2009, at the beginning of the Divali celebrations. The lip-synching isn&rsquo;t bad considering I was listening to a different piece of music at the time.
