[Lost in a moment &#8211; Tokyo][1].

An impromptu film made in Tokyo by Dennis Wheatley and Stefan McClean. They were sitting in this sushi bar pondering how best to set up a camera to film things all by itself whilst they were in Tokyo. Take our hands out of the equation&hellip; let the camera have its own journey.
