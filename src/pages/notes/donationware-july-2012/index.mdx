This month I’ve donated to (or rather, on behalf of) [Xenu’s Link Sleuth](http://home.snafu.de/tilman/xenulink.html). I’ve been using Xenu for many years; it’s one of the few reasons I still maintain a Windows VM.

The [novel donation policy](http://home.snafu.de/tilman/xenulink.html#donation) is good. I contributed to [Wise Beard Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Bunker)’s latest project, [Knowledge Report, The Rise and Fall of the Church of Scientology](http://www.indiegogo.com/knowledgereport).
