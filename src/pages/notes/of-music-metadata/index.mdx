> Music&rsquo;s metadata could once be ignored. The way we valued music in the 1980s and the 1990s is part of a world that no longer exists: when music&rsquo;s economic value has to be reassessed, the way we reassess the music as a whole changes as well. The way we value music might be increasingly moving to metadata.
