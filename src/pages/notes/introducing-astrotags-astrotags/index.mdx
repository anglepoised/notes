[Introducing astrotags][1].

> Astrotags are a new way to label your astronomy photos with their celestial subject and its location. This short film, made by Jim Le Fevre and Mike Paterson for the Royal Observatory&rsquo;s Astronomy Photographer of the Year exhibition, shows you how. So have a watch, then astrotag your pictures at the Astronomy Photographer of the Year group on Flickr. If everyone joins in we can make a beautiful and accurate map of the night sky&hellip; so pass the word on.
