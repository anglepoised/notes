[A review of Sue Barr&#8217;s _gaikoku mura_][1] (&#8216;foreign country villages&#8217;) [photographs][2] at the [Architectural Association][3]:

> The recent establishment in Japan of the gaikoku mura &#8220;foreign village&#8221; theme parks &#8211; caricatured miniature versions of European towns, built according to the local architectural vernacular and featuring famous landmarks &#8211; is audacious but perhaps not so very surprising. Travel to Europe for the Japanese is still expensive, time-consuming and scary &#8211; only one Japanese in four holds a passport. So why fly 13 hours at great expense to Heathrow, and then spend a day finding your way to Stratford, when instead you can hop on the bullet train from Tokyo and, a couple of hours later, be in the Murayama Shakespeare Park?
