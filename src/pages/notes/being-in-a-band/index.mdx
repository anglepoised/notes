> There&rsquo;s a perversion of normal ethical standards, indulged and encouraged by a music industry that feels more important the more it is removed from regular life. For those of us in Shellac and the other bands we admire, being in a band is just part of normal, regular life. You don&rsquo;t act like an asshole when you go to the barber. So why act like an asshole when you&rsquo;re in a band?
