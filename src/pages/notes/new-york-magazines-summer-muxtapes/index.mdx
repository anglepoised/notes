[New York Magazine&#8217;s Summer Muxtapes][1]:

> What jams are rocking [RZA](http://rzaplaylist.muxtape.com/)’s iTunes these days? And what beats are bumping in [Albert Hammond Jr.](http://alberthammondjrplaylist.muxtape.com/)’s ride? In this week’s magazine, we asked members of five New York bands (also including Free Kitten’s [Kim Gordon](http://freekittenplaylist.muxtape.com/), the Jealous Girlfriends’ [Alex Lipsen](http://thejealousgirlfriendsplaylist.muxtape.com/), and Pistolera’s [Sandra Lilia Velasquez](http://pistoleraplaylist.muxtape.com/)) to make playlists for classic New York summer activities.

> [Liner notes here](http://nymag.com/guides/summer/2008/47992/). RZA is the central four chambers of the Wu-Tang Clan, Mr. Hammond plays guitar in The Strokes.

Golly, RZA!
