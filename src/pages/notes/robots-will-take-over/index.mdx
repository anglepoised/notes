[Cursor Miner][1] has been thoughtful enough to provide a [decent selection of mp3s][2] from his recent album, Explosive Piece of Mind.

The idea is that you download them, listen to them and then buy the album from your favourite retailer (whether that be [Amazon UK][3], [Boomkat][4], [Norman Records][5], [PostEverything][6], [Tunes.co.uk][7] or your choice of local record store). Good, eh?
