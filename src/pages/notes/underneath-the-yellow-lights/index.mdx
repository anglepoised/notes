Worked in [Westbourne Studios][1] for a bit, before moving to [less cramped][2] quarters.

> The roof is all the more remarkable when the penny drops: this is not some late-flowering work by Le Corbusier, or even Erno Goldfinger, architect of nearby Trellick Tower, but the underside of the [Westway][3]. Celebrated in song by the Clash, the Westway is the elevated A40(M) that, since 1970, has sent heavy traffic snaking in and out of central London&#8230;. The [developers] are hoping to go one step further: they are seeking permission to create a roof garden for their tenants. The views from the top of [Westbourne Studios][4] are spectacular. Here, the London skyline, in all its messy glory, can be experienced in the round. Traffic scythes through the core of the building; main-line and tube trains make pincer movements around it. The sky is laced with jets whirring into Heathrow at two-minute intervals. A vision of hell for some, perhaps, but an urban rhapsody for young creatives responding to the capital&#8217;s around-the-clock buzz.

Still haven&#8217;t figured out why so many people took their dogs along, though.
