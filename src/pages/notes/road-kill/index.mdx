Occasional [Nerve contributor][1] [JT Leroy][2] is [selling raccoon penis bone necklaces][3] as worn by the truck stop whores in his novel, [Sarah][4].

> &#8220;Raccoon Penis Bones are sexual amulets, used from Texas to Appalachia to enhance sexual luck and performance! Not only that, gamblers often wear or carry a bone for luck.&#8221;

That&#8217;s all my Christmas shopping taken care of.

Related: an [adaptation][5] of [Sarah][6] is underway, with drugstore cowboy [Gus Van Sant][7] directing.
