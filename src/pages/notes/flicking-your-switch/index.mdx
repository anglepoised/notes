Emperor Norton have some [Realaudio versions][1] of three tracks (Seventeen, CrackedLCD and Turn It On) from the forthcoming Ladytron album &#8220;Light and Magic&#8221;, as well as an excellent mix from Ladytron&#8217;s Reuben (featuring tracks from Fat Truckers, Joy Division, Orbital, Sonic Youth, AFX and&#8230; erm&#8230; Phil Collins). Time to download that copy of [Streambox][2], perhaps?
