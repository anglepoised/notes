[Steven Poole: Trigger Happier][1]

Steven Poole is giving away his book Trigger Happy as a DRM-free PDF.

> _Trigger Happy_ is a book about the aesthetics of videogames â€” what they share with cinema, the history of painting, or literature; and what makes them different, in terms of form, psychology and semiotics.
