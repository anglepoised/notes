[Torrez][1] reckons that [even you can do it][2]:

> &#8220;And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s got me so bothered about people musing in their weblogs about projects they&#8217;d like to do. Stop talking about it an just build it. Don&#8217;t make it too complicated. Don&#8217;t spend so much time planning on events that will never happen. Programmers, good programmers, are known for over-engineering to save time later down the road. The problem is that you can over-engineer yourself out of wanting to do the site.&#8221;
