Yabuno Kensei and [326 &#8211; Mi tsu ru][1], have an [exhibition][2] running at [The Spitz][3] from 29 September to 13 October, 2002.

> &#8220;Two of Japan&#8217;s best known cartoon artists use photography creatively to mix with their own unique artwork. Quirky and cute, Kensei and 326&#8217;s work hits universal chords. Themes of family and friendship are familiar to a world wide audience. Mini ninjas walk side by side with angel winged warriors.&#8221;

The Spitz&#8217; element 3 gallery is open all week from noon til 5pm &#8211; admission is free.
