> _Enter Rooney_
>
> **CROWD**: Boooo!
>
> **ROONEY**: Who are they that boo so?
> Our England fans? No, my fair supporters.
> If we are mark&rsquo;d to lose, we hurt enough
> To give our country loss; but if to win,
> After this shabby goalless draw – God&rsquo;s will!
> The greater share of honour ever after.
> Our next match is call&rsquo;d the feast of Capello.
> He that cheers that day, and watches us go through,
> Will rouse him at the name of Capello.
> Then will he yearly on the vigil buy a round,
> Don replica strip and play his vuvuzela,
> And say: &ldquo;Thus did I blow when we beat Slovenia 5-0.&rdquo;
> And gentlemen on couches now in England,
> Shall think themselves accurs&rsquo;d they were not here,
> And swig from lagers cheap whiles any speaks,
> That cheered with us upon Capello&rsquo;s Day.
