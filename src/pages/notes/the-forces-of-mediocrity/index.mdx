> Remarkable visions and genuine insight are always met with resistance. And when you start to make progress, your efforts are met with even more resistance. Products, services, career paths&hellip; whatever it is, the forces for mediocrity will align to stop you, forgiving no errors and never backing down until it&rsquo;s over. If it were any other way, it would be easy.
