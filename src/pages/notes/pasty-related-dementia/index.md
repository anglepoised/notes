Jonathan Meades&#8217; [A-Z of British gastronomy][1]:

> **Full English**: Maugham&#8217;s dictum that if you want to eat well in England you have to eat breakfast three times a day was no doubt an epigram for an epigram&#8217;s sake. But it contained a still pertinent truth. Full English, a hotelier&#8217;s coinage, is all too English in one regard: bacon with mushroom, with choice of eggs, with black pudding, with sausage, with kidneys, with fried bread, with tomatoes&#8230; With, with, with. With is the preferred conjunction of this country&#8217;s professional chefs. They may regard Full English as old hat but a majority of them unwittingly take it as the model for their multipartite creations: seared tuna ossobucco, with chorizo lanyards, with fudge-flavoured couscous, with a gruy&egrave;re filo samosette of okra and spearmint cracklings, with a line-caught sea urchin napping. Like I say: babel.

> Full English is also a specialised form of flagellation.
