Back. Highlights: [Tate St Ives][1] (including the altogether more impressive [Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden][2] and [David Shrigley postcards][3]); [squeezy, tomato-shaped ketchup bottle][4] from [Wimpy][5], clifftop walks, hot, sweet [Lovage][6] in Paul (Paul Lovage?); and a poison-pen letter (literally; half of us had a mystery illness within hours of touching said letter) from a Mousehole resident exhorting us to stop turning Mousehole into our playground and go back to &#8220;London Soho&#8221; with our &#8220;trashy up-country ways&#8221;. Lovely.

For next time: [The Pilchard Works][7] and [Round The Bend (The Museum of Mechanical Madness)][8], both in Newlyn; [saffron cake][9]; just more [Cornish food][10], in fact.
