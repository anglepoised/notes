[The Nerve Interview with Bret Easton Ellis][1] covers Roger Avary&#8217;s [adaptation][2] of [The Rules of Attraction][3]:

> &#8220;One of my only complaints about the movie was that it was so much colder and harsher than the book. It&#8217;s like Kubrick directing a college film. I really thought there was going to be much more of an emotional pull toward the end, and there wasn&#8217;t. This is not a movie to bring your Kleenex to. But I think Roger captured that lack of feeling among college kids as accurate. During that age, you&#8217;re becoming an adult, and in that process you realize, &#8216;Okay, the world works this way, and it&#8217;s hurtful,&#8217; and you pretend it doesn&#8217;t hurt you, and you pose a lot.&#8221;
