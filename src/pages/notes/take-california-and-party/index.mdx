[Matt Groening][1] is curating next year&#8217;s U.S. [All Tomorrow&#8217;s Parties festival][2] (June, UCLA).

> &#8220;Groening, a former rock critic who also pens the &#8220;Life in Hell&#8221; comic strip, has repeatedly said music is his main passion, and described his tastes as &#8220;eccentric.&#8221; Artists he has championed in interviews lean toward the experimental, such as Pere Ubu, Captain Beefheart, Frank Zappa, Diamanda Galas, the Minutemen, and the Residents.&#8221;

No line-up announcements yet but must&#8230; go&#8230;!
