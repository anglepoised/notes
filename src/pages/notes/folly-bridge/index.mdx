[Glossary of Oxford terms][1].

> **Spoonerism**: The accidental or deliberate transposition of the initial letters etc. of two or more words in a phrase. E.g., &#8220;You have tasted a whole worm. You have hissed my mystery lectures. You were caught fighting a liar in the quad. You will leave by the next town drain.&#8221; Named after Revd. William Archibald Spooner (1844-1930) who was Warden of New College, although many &#8216;original&#8217; spoonerisms are now known to be apocryphal.
