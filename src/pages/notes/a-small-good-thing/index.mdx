[Guardian profile of Nicholson Baker][1]:

> &#8230;Baker pulls out his laptop and props it up on his knee: &#8220;At first I&#8217;ll just sit here for a while and yawn and eat an apple,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But then I&#8217;ll get my laptop out. When it is black in here, which it really is, absolutely and totally dark, and I&#8217;m down here with this small fire and I&#8217;ve got my fingers tapping away at the keyboard, I feel like I can type anything I want.&#8221; He lowers the contrast on the screen so that it is the colour of slate, and each keystroke produces a fluorescent letter: &#8220;I can now work here in the dark. I don&#8217;t even have to know that I&#8217;m typing. I just think and my thinking is being recorded. That is part of the feeling, of being in the darkness and following the thoughts wherever they go.&#8221;

Also, a [movie adaptation of The Fermata][2] is apparently heading towards pre-production with Neil Gaiman working on the script and [Robert Zemeckis][3] producing.
