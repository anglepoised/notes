Wevie de Crepon (aka [Wevie Stonder][2]) &#8211; [Ton Wah][1].

&ldquo;Inspired by the endless joy of a talking GPS system on board a breakdown truck (& some high quality gold russian vodka), Wevie explain their own uniquely broken-down geographical position from a vast perspective.&rdquo;

The [12"][3] features a pumped-up version, Mouse on Mars mix, German language version, acapella and samples so you can build your own bollard.
