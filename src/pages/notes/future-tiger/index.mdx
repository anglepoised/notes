[Leaf&#8217;s][1] new label compilation [Lost for Words][2] features tracks from Boom Bip & Doseone, Susumu Yokota, Murcof and The Sons Of Silence and is only three whole English pounds (cheaper than a pint of nasty Central London lager and a packet of paracetamol). The first track, Hana, is by [Asa-Chang & Junray][3]; it&#8217;ll make you want to go and buy his [Jun Ray Song Chang][4] album (which includes the original version of Preach, recently [covered on Otomo Yoshihide&#8217;s Dreams][5]).

> &#8220;Based in Tokyo, self-taught tabla guru Asa-Chang spends his professional life touring with multi-million-selling J-pop acts &#8211; groups that make S Club 7 sound like Joy Division. Regarded as Japan&#8217;s premier session percussionist, in his spare time this loveable eccentric makes music that might just blow your head off.&#8221;
