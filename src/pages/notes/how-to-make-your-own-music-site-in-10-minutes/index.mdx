> What you’ll be creating is an automated music tumblelog. The site will monitor the songs you’re listening to in iTunes or other popular MP3 players. When you listen to a new song that hasn’t been posted to your music tumblelog, the site will automatically scour the internet for a MP3 matching that new track. If it finds one, it will be posted to your site as a link with artist and track info. Visitors to the site can listen to individual tracks or play up to 15 songs per page as a playlist.

This is brilliant. I&rsquo;m a little late to the party; mine is called [In the Beams][2].
